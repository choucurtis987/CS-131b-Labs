# School Labs
- this is a repository for my "cs131b: python programming" labs
- all files will contain some comments to explain what is going on within the code
- all coding is done by me personally
- browse around to find some cool mini projects done in my first programming class
- for reference: I took the class during the spring semester of my senior year in high school
